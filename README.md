# shoppe
A project that will be using api. creating a fake store where the user can make purchases and even delete the purchases from the cart and even include a checkout feature
this project will have videos of me working on it and even show some challenges and ideas to put into the shop
the key parts of this project will be subject through using the Software Development Life Cycle (SLDC)
...still learning more on frontend frameworks(React, Angular, Vue) so instead I will be using a CSS framework (bootstrap5 or Bulma)
